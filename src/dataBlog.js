        text: "On the effect and purpose of hypoventilation techniques of pranayama. Kumbhaka (breath-holding) as the ultimate form of controlled hypoventilation. Practical recommendations for practitioners of yoga and pranayama.",
        text2: [
            {p: <h3>Kumbhaka: concept</h3>},
            {p: <p>"Kumbhaka" is simultaneously a practice and the outcome of the practice, specifically serving as an indicator of a yogi's level of training in the stage of mastering pranayama according to the eightfold system of yoga by Patanjali. In the "Yoga Sutras," pranayama is described as the "arrest of inhalation and exhalation" [2:49].</p>},
            {p: <p>In general, the word “stop” better reflects the essence of the yogic practice of kumbhaka than the more common translation of the Sanskrit term “breath retention.” Stopping breathing happens spontaneously, naturally and easily, while holding it seems to require efforts aimed at suppressing the body’s natural need to breathe. However, in order for something to happen easily and spontaneously, you need to go for a long time and methodically, developing certain skills and increasing control, which certainly requires effort, diligence and discipline.</p>},
            {p: ``},
            {p: <p>Breath-holding for training purposes can be performed after inhalation, when the air is held inside (antar kumbhaka), or after exhalation, when the air is held outside (bahir kumbhaka).</p>},
            {p: <p>At the initial stage it is recommended to practice antar kumbhaka, because many people find it even psychologically easier (and the brain does not immediately sound the alarm), which allows them to adapt to hypoxic loads. If you perform hyperventilation technique (for example, kapalabhati breathing or bhastrika-pranayama) before stopping breathing, then even a beginner will be able to go beyond the mark of 45 seconds during compensatory delay. And this is the mark that must be overcome to arrive at hypercapnia (see above).
                However, antar kumbhaka (i.e., holding the breath after inhalation) is not as simple a technique as it may seem at first glance. It is important to learn how to hold the air through the coordinated work of the respiratory muscles rather than by constricting the vocal chord.</p>},
            {p: <p>Mechanical blockage of the larynx (when you literally block the air by squeezing the vocal chord) increases intracranial pressure and disrupts metabolic processes in brain tissue. If the vocal cleft is open, the intracranial pressure remains normal. Therefore, the delay should be performed due to static contraction of respiratory muscles stabilizing the position of the chest, against the background of relaxation of other muscle groups. It is no coincidence that the practice of pranayamas is preceded by the practice of yoga asanas: the ability to isolate the work of key muscles and read their proprioceptive response is developed through asana practice.</p>},
            {p: <p>As far as bahir kumbhaka is concerned, the following guidelines are worth considering:</p>},
            {p: <p>1. prolonged exhalation hold should be practiced only with the support of traya bandha, maha mudra, or three locks, as it is necessary to create negative pressure in the chest to ensure adequate blood flow to the brain;</p>},
            {p: <p>2. bahir kumbhaka should be practiced only after mastering and long training of antar kumbhaka, because during external delay a person experiences more serious hypoxic load (after full exhalation there is practically no oxygen left in the lungs), and therefore needs additional training of the respiratory system.</p>},
            {p: <h3>Contraindications</h3>},
            {p: <p>The practice of delays is contraindicated in functional disorders of the cardiovascular and respiratory system, ischemic conditions, various disorders of blood coagulation (both with a tendency to thrombosis and increased bleeding), as well as during pregnancy.</p>},
            {p: <h3>Kumbhaka: where to start?</h3>},
            {p: <p>Even if you are just starting to practice yoga, and focused work with the breath causes boredom and misunderstanding, combine the practice of yoga asanas with ujjayi breathing, decanting air through the constricted vocal cleft with a characteristic noise and friction. Ujjayi breathing has a weakly pronounced hypoventilation effect, as it allows you to significantly lengthen the respiratory cycle. Therefore, more or less long practice of asanas accompanied by ujjayi will favorably affect the state of mitochondria, and you will get used to keep focus of attention on breathing and learn to control it.</p>},
            {p: <p>When you have learned to relax in shavasana and have developed sufficient motor control to remain still for long periods of time without pronounced discomfort, gradually introduce the practice of prana-vyayamas into your regimen. Prana-vyayamas are a corpus of exercises that allow you to develop and strengthen your respiratory muscles to prepare for the more serious hypoxic stresses of kumbhaka practice. And let it be just one practice per week of 15-20 minutes, the important thing is to repeat it systematically for 2-3 months.</p>},
            {p: <p>A systematic approach to organizing the training process has an accumulative effect. Therefore, after some time you will literally feel a surge of strength and vigor and notice that you are less fixated on destructive thoughts, it is easier to keep your composure in critical situations, it is easier to recover and adapt to new conditions.</p>},

        text: "Practical recommendations for beginners. Typical mistakes and misconceptions at the initial stage.",
        text2: [
            {p: `How do I learn to meditate? The very statement of the question implies that we are waiting for instructions on how to attune our mind and body to meditation. But the secret is that the mind and body do not need to be trained in any special way. Meditation should be practiced.`},
            {p: `Meditation is not some secret technique. It is essentially a practice of self-observation. You become aware of the activity of the mind and the reactions of the psyche in the moment, without engaging in a train of thought or allowing emotions to pull you out of a state of inner balance, open presence and clear awareness.`},
            {p: `To reach this state, to learn to stay in it for longer than a moment, and if necessary, to return to it at any moment, you can and should practice relaxation and concentration. However, it is important to realize that meditation is not about relaxing to pleasant music or focusing on your own thoughts. Meditation is a transcendent state of mind that "quiets down" as soon as it becomes aware of itself. In this state, consciousness seems to be zeroed out, as filters that "color" the processes of perception and thinking of a person in the color of his beliefs disappear, and at the same time it expands, as all kinds of barriers that limit cognition of oneself and the world are removed.`},
            {p: `The state of meditation is outside the realm that can be characterized by the apparatus of thinking, that is, described in words, represented in the form of a scheme, graph, formula, etc. Therefore, meditation cannot be taught. The only thing that can be taught is various techniques of relaxation and concentration, which serve as a means of achieving the state of meditation. It is impossible to predict which technique will suit you. Everything depends on the peculiarities of your psyche, the nature of which can only be understood by you, practicing meditation.`},
            {p: `All sorts of "meditation techniques", which today are presented under the sauce of different schools and methods, in fact, are a set of specific techniques for "curbing the mind" through relaxation and concentration. The actual practice of meditation is reduced to the three actions described above, rather than to the mastery of disparate techniques, but you have to start somewhere (see the article "Meditation Techniques").`},
            {p: <img className='img_blog_content' src={imgCont1} alt="blog"/>},
            {p: <p>Of course, at the initial stage it can be very difficult to practice meditation without using these techniques: how to relax if there is something in the body that hurts, itches, pulls or aching, and something in the mind that worries, disturbs and burdens; how to concentrate if thoughts are racing, emotions are taking over, and attention is slipping away. Therefore, below I will give a number of practical recommendations, observance of which will help you to curb your mind and tune in to the practice of meditation, even without knowledge of special techniques, which you can master in the future, if you want to practice meditation in this or that tradition.</p>},
            {p: `1. TIME. It is best to practice meditation at a certain time, then your body will automatically adjust to relaxation and your mind to calmness. In the same way, your digestive organs prepare themselves for food if you stick to a regimen in your diet. Without a doubt, the best time to meditate is early morning when the body is still in a relaxed state and the mind is not cluttered with daily chores and worries. The rarefied state of atmosphere that is celebrated at dawn makes one's mind clearer and more perceptive. This is why morning meditation practice is usually the easiest and most productive (for the benefits of morning practice, see the article "The Best Time for Yoga").`},
            {p: `2. DURATION. Start with 5 minutes of meditation a day and gradually increase the duration of practice by 1-2 minutes each week). It is better to move in small steps, but to practice meditation every day, than to set yourself the task of immediately "sitting" 20-30 minutes, then reduce the practice to 15 minutes, and then abandon it altogether.`},
            {p: `3. FREQUENCY. The more frequent, the better. Optimally, every day. Consider that if you skipped meditation today, you took a step backward. And you are unlikely to see the fruits of your practice anytime soon. Prolonged interruptions in practice can lead to emotional instability and even feelings of emptiness. Regular meditation practice, on the other hand, can be your rock in times of instability and crisis.`},
            {p: `4. LOCATION. If possible, choose a place protected from drafts and other external influences: noise, cold, vibrations, etc. If possible, try to do the practice in the same place and/or on the same mat/cushion if you are traveling. As it is always easier to relax and calm down in familiar surroundings. However, even if you didn't bring your yoga mat or favorite meditation cushion with you on your trip, that's no reason to skip the practice.`},
            {p: `5. CLOTHING. Any comfortable clothing that does not restrict movement, including chest movement. If insects are flying and crawling around, exercise under a net. In a relaxed state the body quickly cools down, so it is not superfluous to put on a shawl or a light plaid for a comfortable stay in a motionless state, if you practice longer than 5-10 minutes.`},
            {p: `6. POSITION. The optimal position is sitting cross-legged on the floor. If you are unable to bring your knees to pelvic level, place a pillow, bolster or folded blanket under your buttocks. When you sit cross-legged on a support, it is much easier to control the position of your spine and your legs will not get stiff. You can also practice meditation sitting on a chair or sitting on your knees in hero pose. The main condition is that your back should be straight and your position stable, then the load will be evenly distributed between the sciatic bones and along the spinal column. The spinal traction position will allow you to remain awake throughout the practice.`},
            {p: `7. EXPECTATIONS and OUTCOME. Do not set any expectations. Don't be disappointed or happy about the results of the practice. Even if you are not able to "curb" the mind, you cannot relax and concentrate, your intention to give time to practice, i.e. to try to let go of mental and bodily tension and at least for a few seconds to keep your attention on this or that object, the training effect will be achieved. And next time it will be easier for you! Everyone who practices meditation has encountered frustration and a feeling of wasted time. Don't give up. No skill comes by itself. Every skill has to be developed.`},
            {p: `8. The Power of Intention. Do not try to quiet your mind, i.e., literally silence it, in order to arrive at a state of meditation. Obsession with the result creates excessive mental tension, which, as we already know, must be released: a vicious circle. To attune yourself to meditation, all it takes is your intention to practice: to be aware of the activity of your mind and watch thoughts unfold and reactions arise. It's as if you're on the side of the highway watching the cars whiz by. Or standing beside a stream in an autumn forest and watching dry leaves float by.`},
            {p: `9. Stress. Many people claim that meditation is a stress reliever. The paradox is that one can only come to inner balance and experience the state of meditation (i.e., a state of zeroing in and expanding consciousness) in the absence of stress. Of course, practicing meditation (i.e., trying to reach this state) has a beneficial effect on the psyche and raises the threshold of stress tolerance. People who regularly practice meditation are less susceptible to stressors because they can more easily and quickly switch from being fixated on an idea or emotion.`},
            {p: `10. Relaxation. An important condition for practicing meditation is activation of the parasympathetic mode of functioning of the nervous system, when the body rests and the mind relaxes. Modern man is more often in the state of "run, fight, defend", i.e. in the mode of dominance of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system, when the mind is most excited. To stimulate the parasympathetic nerve fibers, you can perform appropriate breathing techniques with bandhas holding, if you practice pranayama. It will be enough to try to make inhalations deeper and exhalations longer. Deep bends in standing or sitting positions and asanas such as halasana (plow pose), salamba sarvangasana (shoulder stand) are also suitable for activating the parasympathetics. Regular practice of shavasana and/or yoga nidra also helps develop the skill of PSNS activation and conscious relaxation.`},
            {p: `11. Concentration. As an object of concentration for meditation practice, you can choose something that appeals to you on an intuitive level. It can be a sound or a set of sounds (for example, a mantra), an object (both real and imaginary), a symbol (a word or a sign), an image (of a person or a god), a process (breathing, heartbeat, movement of a flame, flow of water), a part of a body (a point in the area between the eyebrows, the tip of a nose), an image (a point on a wall, a photograph of a person, a landscape in a painting), etc. At the initial stage you can try to focus on different objects and points, but with time try to choose one thing for yourself and use only this technique for some time to feel the fruits of your practice. For more information about different concentration techniques, see the article "Meditation Techniques".`},
            {p: `I hope that these guidelines will allow you to set aside your doubts and put aside your search for miracle recipes and know-how that will teach you how to "meditate". The process of self-discovery begins with your intention to explore the activity of your mind. Practicing meditation will allow you to channel this process and lead you to great discoveries about your potential: you definitely can, and you will succeed. If you learn to control your inner state, you can control the course of your life.`},

            {p: `"Shavasana translates from Sanskrit as "corpse pose" (शव sava [shava] - corpse). It is usually performed after the main practice, but can also be done separately when there is a need for deep relaxation.`},
            {p: `Sometimes we come across the opinion that shavasana is an unnecessary stage, because there are plenty of more "useful" things to do during this time. If you've been to group classes at the studio, you may have noticed that some practitioners simply leave while the group is settling into shavasana. As a result, a few minutes saved in this way affect the result of the whole practice in a bad way.`},
            {p: `Look at shavasana not as a waste of time, but as a necessary part of the class. Just as important as the setup and the main asana sequence. Even if you're not tired. Even if you can come and lie down at home in a more comfortable environment. The main task of shavasana is to balance the state of the body and nervous system, to integrate the motor experience gained during the class. Literally "record" it in the motor cortex of the brain and at the level of the fascial system.`},
            {p: `If you decide to skip shavasana or do it at home, the new pattern of coordination and movement will have a harder time taking hold. You will go home using habitual movement patterns and possibly with an agitated nervous system. It will be much more difficult to come to a dominant harmonious state and to develop new physical competencies with this approach.`},
            {p: `SHAVASANA POSE`},
            {p: `Assume a comfortable position lying on your back. Spread your arms and legs slightly to release the groin and axillary lymph nodes. The palms of your hands should be turned upwards. If you feel tension in the back of your neck or throat, you can place a small support under your head, such as a yoga blanket (not a soft one! your head should not fall into it like a featherbed).`},
            {p: `If there is tension in the lower back or hyperlordosis, you can place a bolster under the knees to help the lower back relax.

            Then relax the body as much as possible by scanning the body with attention from the bottom up or top down, consciously relaxing the segment where the attention is now.`},
            {p: `Music for shavasana is not obligatory, but you can play a track that is pleasant to the ear. It is desirable that the composition should be without words or at least in an unfamiliar language: such accompaniment will attract less attention, because it will be needed to track bodily sensations.`},
            {p: `PREPARING for SHAVASANA`},
            {p: `1. Keep warm even if you don't feel cold yet. When your body is lying still, you may feel a slight chill after 3 to 5 minutes. This will prevent your muscles from fully relaxing and your mind from calming down. Put on a sweater and warm socks beforehand or cover yourself with a blanket.`},
            {p: `2. Stop the hustle and bustle of the mind. If shavasana is voice-guided, focus on the sensations in the areas of the body that the teacher's voice is guiding you through. By immersing yourself in them, you will literally switch your perception from mental "bubblegum" to bodily sensations, which will enhance the effect of shavasana.`},
            {p: `If you are doing shavasana without voice accompaniment and cannot distract yourself from intrusive thoughts, switch to observing the breath. Repeat to yourself on each inhale/exhale cycle, observing the depth and rhythm of your breathing. If you notice you get distracted, just go back again and repeat the "inhale-outhale" to yourself. The brain can't match such counting and the work of the brain's anxiety center, the amygdala, which generates and races around anxious thoughts. After a few minutes they will go away, only breathing and deep relaxation will remain.`},
            {p: `3. Use a shavasana pad, it works on two levels at once:`},
            {p: `- Superficial. It blocks the access of light through the eyelids, it generally helps to relax.`},
            {p: `- At the level of the nervous system. The gentle pressure prevents the eyeballs from moving and the oculomotor muscles are allowed to relax. This, in turn, reduces the tension level of the mind and nervous system as a whole.`},
            {p: `If you can't relax in shavasana, it's likely that your natural sympathetic/parasympathetic switching mechanism is disrupted due to chronic stress. It is all the more important to learn to relax after activity. If this skill is not restored, it is a direct path to burnout, sleep disorders and nervous exhaustion.`},

However, it is nothing more than a preventive procedure available to every person who is conscious about taking care of his or her health.`},
            {p: `Today, so-called sadhu boards (in Sanskrit, "sadhaka" or "sadhu" means disciple and "sadhana" means practice) are produced especially for this procedure. Standing on a sadhu board is an ascesis, a training of the will, an influence on energy flows, and a practice of mindfulness that helps to renew mental and motor patterns.`},
            {p: `In this article, we will take a closer look at all aspects of this practice.`},
            {p: `Physiology`},
            {p: `The most obvious benefit of standing on nails is the stimulation of physiological processes that have health-promoting effects on the body.`},
            {p: `The average urban person's feet are shod in uncomfortable shoes and walk on hard, flat surfaces such as tiles, asphalt, or the floor of the house. The complex mechanics of the foot remains unused, as there is not enough movement in the small joints, which means that the trophic (i.e. nutrition) of tissues is disturbed. As a result, fatty, muscular, connective tissues, which should provide movement and cushioning of the feet, begin to accumulate residual products of cellular metabolism, and lymph, due to the prolonged lack of muscle activity, is simply unable to remove the accumulated products of cell metabolism and remove them from the body through the excretory system.`},
            {p: `The practice of standing on nails powerfully stimulates blood and lymph flow in these stale tissues. In response to a pain signal, the immune system sends its "agents" - immune cells - out to explore. As a result of their activity, waste products of metabolism are eliminated, cell nutrition is improved, and the conscious triggering of such a process develops proprioception (body awareness).`},
            {p: `Important! Standing on nails does not eliminate the need to work the feet and perform special exercises. The more attention you pay to them, the better. Do not transfer to nails the work that should be realized through proper motor activity`},
            {p: `Below we provide links to popular video lessons at Yanta Yoga School that will thoroughly work your feet and improve ankle mobility.`},
            {p: `Standing on nails technique`},
            {p: `It is recommended to do a short yoga asana practice or meditation beforehand: this will help to set the mood and calm the mind. Standing on the nails in an agitated state or in strong emotions, especially negative ones, will make it difficult to bear the pressure, and instead of calmness and ease, you may get an escalation of negative feelings.`},
            {p: `Important: Make sure that there are no skin lesions or fungal diseases on the feet. Even if the board is personal, you should not practice nailing if the skin is damaged.`},
            {p: `For beginners and people with hypersensitivity, it is advisable to start by standing on the board from a chair and with support (e.g. on a table or on an assistant's arm). This allows the body weight to be distributed on 2 feet at once and reduces discomfort. In time you will be able to step onto the board from a standing position, but it is still desirable to have a support at hand: a table, your mentor's hands, a chair, a handrail, etc. It is optimal to practice every day. If you don't have such an opportunity - no worries, choose a convenient mode for you. As in any training, regularity and systematicity are important.`},
            {p: `The sensation of standing on nails is, to put it bluntly, unusual and the body may be perceived as a danger. This means that it is automatically mobilized: the musculature tones up, the head "goes" into the shoulders, the eye-motor and suboccipital muscles tense up, and breathing becomes shallow. If you keep this tension in the body, the practice of nailing will not have any beneficial effect.`},
            {p: `After surviving the first seconds of shock, you need to gradually release the tension in the muscles and let them "flow" to the feet. If you practice yoga, the skill of relaxing muscles that are not involved in movement has already been practiced. If not, it will take more time to do it, but sooner or later the skill will be formed.`},
            {p: `How long to stand depends on your training. You can start with 10 seconds, gradually increasing the time little by little. Advanced practitioners stand on the nails for about half an hour on average. When you manage to stand quietly for several minutes, from time to time you can do "stepping over": slightly change the position of your feet on the board to involve more energy points.`},
            {p: `Standing on nails can only be harmful if you are overly sensitive: if your nervous system and psyche are very reactive, the sensations will be too vivid and will bring nothing but stress. In such a case, you can start practicing sitting until the sensations become habitual, or you can give it up. The practice will be ineffective if you remain in tension all the time without trying to get rid of it and accept pain, discomfort and resistance of the mind as part of the practice.`},

            {p: `Modern scientists, as well as ancient yoga masters, agree that a person operates only a small part of the brain's resources. Most of them remain inaccessible, hidden deep in the subconscious. In a normal state of consciousness a person has no access to them, as he cannot interact with his subconscious mind directly.`},
            {p: `Yoga nidra gives you the opportunity to open access to the subconscious mind in a state of deep relaxation. If you perform this technique regularly, you can solve everyday tasks more creatively, assimilate new knowledge more effectively, and most importantly, get rid of the burden of accumulated tension and prevent various psychosomatic disorders.`},
            {p: `During the day, the mind's resources are spent processing information that comes through the sensory perception organs and related cognitive processes. At the edge of sleep and wakefulness, the brain is in a state of inhibition: the wave activity of the cerebral cortex is significantly reduced, while its receptivity remains very high. The brain stops reacting to external stimuli, but does not fall into sleep, in this state there is spontaneous contact with the sphere of the unconscious: a person is gently immersed in the bowels of his psyche. As Swami Satyananda, the founder of the method, writes: "If consciousness is separated from both external perception and sleep, it is filled with power that can be used for various purposes: strengthening memory, accumulating knowledge, increasing creativity, transforming the whole personality.`},
            {p: `It is important to realize that yoga nidra is not meditation or sleep, it is a very special technique of conscious psychophysical relaxation, which is based on 2 conditions:`},
            {p: `- awake consciousness;`},
            {p: `- full involvement of the mind in the process of gradual relaxation.`},
            {p: `If these conditions are met, correctly voiced information is assimilated many times faster than in the normal state of consciousness.`},
            {p: `
            The experiment often cited as evidence involves Swami Satyananda, who was tasked with educating a difficult child in an ashram. The student was a real troublemaker, and traditional educational methods were not effective with him. That's when Satyananda decided to try teaching through yoga nidra. He would read excerpts from the sacred scripture Bhagavad Gita to the boy as soon as he began to doze off. Within a week of such sessions, the unruly student had completely absorbed the text. In the end, he learned more than 10 languages in two years and mastered many complex texts without spending hours poring over books.`},
