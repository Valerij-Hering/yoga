These eight limbs define the different methods that students can work with to find freedom from the compulsive nature of the mind and all the many different ways we suffer. So often we spend our time worrying about the unknown, dwelling on the past or just living in fear. These habitual ways of interfacing with life so often dominate our experiences that even when things are going great for us, we don't necessarily enjoy it! Gradually, these yogic practices help us look at the places in our lives where we get stuck and suffer. They also give us tools to start making different choices in those areas.",

The leader reads out the text of the nidra, guiding the listener's attention to all parts of the body in a certain sequence. Fulfillment of such instructions does not require analysis and any intellectual effort at all, as a result, inhibition processes begin to prevail in the cerebral cortex, and a state close to trance occurs. From the analysis of everyday stimuli, attention is switched to contemplation.",
